        <h3><u>George Boole</u></h3> 
        <br>
        <p>inventor of Boolean algebra (the basis of modern computer arithmetic) lived in Ballintemple during his time as Professor of Mathematics at University College Cork. Boole is buried in the grounds of St. Michael's Church of Ireland on Church Road.</p>
        <br>
    
        <p>George Boole (2 November 1815 â€“ 8 December 1864) was a largely self-taught English mathematician, philosopher, and logician, most of whose short career was spent as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork in Ireland. He worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic, and is best known as the author of The Laws of Thought (1854) which contains Boolean algebra. 
        <br>
            <p>Boolean logic is credited with laying the foundations for the Information Age.</p>
          <br>
          <p>  Boole maintained that:
            "No general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise, not only the special numerical bases of the science, but also those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning, and which, whatever they may be as to their essence, are at least mathematical as to their form."</p>

        <h3><u>Architect Thomas Deane</u></h3> 
        <br>
        <p>Built a home on the grounds of Dundanion Castle, and his architect son and grandson (Thomas Newenham Deane and Thomas Manly Deane) also lived in the area.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>Deane was to the forefront of the development of the arts and sciences in his native city. He served on Cork Corporation for many years. He was Mayor of Cork in 1815, 1830 and 1851, and was knighted in 1830. He was a staunch Tory, but ended up supporting a Catholic, Daniel Callaghan, in 1830. Later in life he grew tired of the political in-fighting</p>

        <h3><u>Wayne Sherlock</u></h3>
        <br>
        <p>(born 21 June 1978) is an Irish retired hurler who played for Cork Senior Championship club Blackrock. He played for the Cork senior hurling team for 8 seasons, starting as a right wing-back before later lining out as a right corner-back. Sherlock is considered to be one of the greatest defenders of his era.</p>
        <br>
       <p> Sherlock began his hurling career at club level with Ballinure before transferring to the nearby Blackrock club. He broke onto the club's top adult team straight out of the minor grade in 1996. Sherlock made 69 championship appearances for the club before his retirement in 2012 and was part of the Cork Senior Championship-winning teams of 1999, 2001 and 2002.</p>
