<h3><u>Site Structure</u></h3>
<p>History of Blackrock website has four pages. The home page is the default loading page, Events, Residents and Contact page are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu which is an ever present on all pages. The navigation bar allows for easy navigation without having to use the browsers arrows buttons. Headings allow you to see where you are at all times on the website as well as your location being highlighted in white on the navigation bar<p>

<h3><u>Design Choices</u></h3>
<li>Typography</li>
<p>The font used across the website was Sans Serif,Sans is a French word meaning "without". Thus, a sans serif is a typeface that has no traces or lines extending from the edges of letters and alphabets. This way, there are no curls, and the sans serif letters appear simple and rounded. The Sans font is clean and the best font for reading on screen.<p>

<li>Color Scheme</li>
<p>The colors I have selected are displayed in the pallette below, I chose these colours as I find the contrast pleasent to look at and also find the content easy to identify.
